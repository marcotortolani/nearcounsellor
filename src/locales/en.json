  "why_i_did_this_title": "The story behind this website",
  "why_i_did_this_description": "I am Cinthia's partner, and this website is my gift to her. She doesn't know about it yet, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please direct them to me at info@nearcounselling.co.nz. \n\nCinthia is originally from Argentina. She lived in Brazil for four years and has been in New Zealand for more than six years, including four in Wellington. She is now based in Auckland and is in the final stage of her counselling degree at AUT (Auckland University of Technology).\n\n Over the years, she has already completed more than 100 supervised counselling hours. Those who have worked with her often describe her as empathetic, thoughtful, and genuine. Although she isn't officially promoting herself as a counsellor yet, her presence and guidance have already made a positive difference for many people.\n\n Like many full-time students, balancing study and work hasn't been easy. Even though tuition is reduced for residents, the costs are still high, and her schedule changes each semester, making part-time jobs hard to fit in. Instead of focusing on short-term work just to get by, my hope is that she can start slowly building her professional practice, helping people along the way and sharing the gift she naturally has for connecting with others.\n\n Here you will also find “Who is Cinthia?” along with messages from friends and people she has supported. Don't just take my word for it, read what others have to say about her warmth, energy, and dedication here (link to Who is Cinthia?).\n\n The purpose of this website is simple: to give her the chance to continue developing as a counsellor, to create space for her voice, and to allow her to reach those who may need her the most now.",
  "how_can_she_help_me_title": "But she's not a counsellor yet, how can she help me?",
  "how_can_she_help_me_description": "The great thing about Cinthia is that if you bring something she cannot treat, she will tell you honestly and refer you. A few weeks ago, after completing her supervised 100 hours, I asked her if she could start a private practice and at what level. She said she could offer short therapies (focused on a specific problem), provide practical tools, and then let participants continue on their own.",
  "how_is_cinthia_title": "Meet Cinthia and her resilence",
  "how_is_cinthia_description": "Cinthia is one of those people you don't think exist in real life. Someone who gives so much of herself to others, with a genuine interest in helping and an incredible capacity to adapt.\n\n I've seen her go through very tough situations, but the story from 2011 always comes to mind (it somehow defines her). She left everything in Argentina and went to live in Brazil with a plan (one of those plans that seems infallible before the trip, but once you arrive, it doesn't always work out). And that's what happened.\n\n In the first weeks, she worked for just a plate of food to survive, without even understanding the language. We are not talking about someone who freezes in a crisis. We are talking about someone who reacts, adjusts, does what needs to be done, and keeps going.\n\n She knows what it is to hit rock bottom and rise again.",
