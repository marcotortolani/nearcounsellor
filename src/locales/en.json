  "why_i_did_this_title": "How it began?",
  "why_i_did_this_description": "I am Cinthia's partner. She already has over 100 supervised hours as a counsellor. We live in Auckland, but she's from Argentina, lived in Brazil for four years, and has been here for more than six (including four in Wellington). She is currently in the last part of her counselling degree at AUT (the Auckland University of Technology).\n\n This website is my gift to her (and yes, she has no idea about any of this yet). If there's any criticism (even constructive), please direct it to me, because she doesn't know anything yet.\n\n Financially, it has been tough for her. Although as New Zealand residents the university fees are cheaper, it is still expensive. And as a full-time student, it is hard to find a part-time job that fits (especially since her schedule changes every semester). She doesn't dare to promote herself as a counsellor (because she isn't officially one yet), but she is able to give you that advice you might have neededâ€¦ and didn't know you needed.\n\n Here you can also read Who is Cinthia?, messages written by friends and people she has helped in the past. Don't just take my word for it, there's real value in reading what those who have been by her side and connected with her beautiful personality and energy have to say.\n\n The purpose of this website is simple: for her not to end up in random part-time jobs just to stay afloat, but instead to start slowly building her professional practice (and in the process, help as many people as she can).",
  "how_can_she_help_me_title": "But she's not a counsellor yet, how can she help me?",
  "how_can_she_help_me_description": "The great thing about Cinthia is that if you bring something she cannot treat, she will tell you honestly and refer you. A few weeks ago, after completing her supervised 100 hours, I asked her if she could start a private practice and at what level. She said she could offer short therapies (focused on a specific problem), provide practical tools, and then let participants continue on their own.",
  "how_is_cinthia_title": "How is Cinthia?",
  "how_is_cinthia_description": "Cinthia is one of those people you think don't exist in real life. Someone who gives so much of herself to others, with a genuine interest in helping and an incredible capacity to adapt.\n\n I've seen her go through very tough situations, but the story from 2011 always comes to mind (it somehow defines her). She left everything in Argentina and went to live in Brazil with a plan (one of those plans that seems infallible before the trip), but once you arrive, it doesn't always work out. And that's what happened.\n\n In the first weeks, she worked for just a plate of food to survive, without even understanding the language. We are not talking about someone who freezes in a crisis. We are talking about someone who reacts, adjusts, does what needs to be done, and keeps going.\n\n She knows what it is to hit rock bottom and rise again.",
