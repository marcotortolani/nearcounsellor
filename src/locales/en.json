    "why_i_did_this_description": "Cinthia already has over 100 supervised hours as a counsellor. We live in Auckland, but she's from Argentina, lived in Brazil for four years, and here for over six (four in Wellington). She's currently in the second part of her counselling degree at AUT, the Auckland University of Technology. This website is my gift to her, and yes... she has no idea about any of this, so if there's any criticism (even if constructive), please direct it to me because she doesn't know anything yet ðŸ˜„\n\nFinancially, it's been tough for her. Although as residents the university is cheaper, it's still expensive, and as a full-time student, it's hard to find a part-time job that fits, especially since her schedule changes every semester, leaving her in a bind. She doesn't dare to promote herself as a counsellor (because she isn't one yet), but she can give you that advice you might have needed... and didn't know you needed.\n\nHere you can read Proof of Character, messages written by friends or people she has helped in the past. Don't just take my word for it; there's great value in reading what those who have had the pleasure of being by her side and connecting with her beautiful personality and energy have to say.\n\nWhat's the purpose of this website? For her not to end up looking for any random part-time job that just keeps her afloat, but to start slowly building her professional practice.\n\nâ€” Hey, but she's not a counsellor, how can she help me?\n\nThe great thing about Cinthia is that if you bring something she can't treat, she will tell you and refer you. I asked her if she could start a private practice and at what level. She said she could offer short therapies (up to six sessions) for a specific problem, give you tools, and then you could continue on your own.",
